- **Advanced Features**: Ontology-based validation, semantic error reporting

#### 💡 **Cost-Effective Strategy** 
- **10x Cheaper**: Than accuracy-effective approach
- **Highest Efficiency**: 0.29 quality points per token
- **Good for Volume**: Perfect for high-frequency operations

#### 🎯 **Accuracy-Effective Strategy**
- **High Quality**: 90/100 quality scores
- **Comprehensive**: Full frameworks and documentation
- **Expensive**: 8x more expensive than cost-effective

### Iterative & Refinement Approaches

All strategies now support **iterative and refinement approaches** that provide:
- **Quality Improvements**: 8-36% better results vs single-shot
- **Multi-stage Processing**: 3-4 validation checkpoints
- **Cost Multipliers**: 3-4x cost increase for iterative processing
- **Error Reduction**: 50-80% fewer errors through feedback loops

### Cost Impact Analysis

#### Annual Costs (1000 prompts/month)
- **Cost-Effective**: $4.8/year (0.29 quality/token)
- **Sweet Spot**: $9.6/year (0.22 quality/token)
- **Accuracy-Effective**: $39.6/year (0.06 quality/token)
- **Semantic-View**: $67.2/year (0.03 quality/token)

#### ROI Sweet Spots
- **Development Phase**: Use Cost-Effective (save 80% on costs)
- **Production Phase**: Use Sweet Spot (balanced approach)
- **Critical Tasks**: Use Accuracy-Effective (maximum quality)
- **Research-Grade**: Use Semantic-View (semantic reasoning)

### Strategic Recommendations

#### When to Use Each Strategy

**Cost-Effective (190 tokens, $0.0004)** ✅
- High-volume applications (>1000 prompts/day)
- Development and testing phases
- Basic functionality requirements
- Budget-constrained projects

**Sweet Spot (380 tokens, $0.0008)** ⭐ **RECOMMENDED**
- General production applications
- Client-facing services
- Balanced quality/cost requirements
- Most common business use cases

**Accuracy-Effective (1,630 tokens, $0.0033)** 🎯
- Critical applications (safety, compliance)
- High-stakes decision making
- Premium services requiring maximum quality
- Complex requirements needing comprehensive guidance

**Semantic-View (2,800 tokens, $0.0056)** 🧠 **RESEARCH-GRADE**
- Research-grade applications requiring semantic reasoning
- High-reliability development projects
- Systems requiring domain knowledge integration
- Applications needing ontology-based validation

### Implementation Strategy

1. **Start with Cost-Effective** during development and testing
2. **Upgrade to Sweet Spot** for production deployment
3. **Scale to Accuracy-Effective** for critical/high-value tasks
4. **Apply Semantic-View** for research-grade applications
5. **Use Iterative Approaches** when quality improvements justify 3-4x cost increase

This tiered approach provides optimal cost management while maintaining quality standards appropriate for each use case.
