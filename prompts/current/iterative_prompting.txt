# Sequential Function Chart (SFC) Equivalence Enhancement Task

## Objective
You are tasked with modifying SFC2 (Sequential Function Chart 2) to achieve behavioral equivalence with SFC1. This involves adding missing execution paths from SFC1 to SFC2's `steps2` and `transitions2` data structures.

## Context
- **SFC (Sequential Function Chart)**: A programming model that defines states (steps) and transitions between them
- **Equivalence Goal**: SFC2 should be able to execute all the same logical paths as SFC1
- **Missing Paths**: The paths listed below exist in SFC1 but have no equivalent execution path in SFC2

## Input Data

### Non-Equivalent Paths (SFC1 → SFC2)
```
From Step    To Step      Transitions       Z3 Condition            Z3 Data Transformation
{non_equiv_paths_str}
```

### Current SFC2 Implementation
```python
{sfc2_code}
```

### Reference SFC1 Implementation
```python
{sfc1_code}
```

## Task Requirements

### 1. Code Modifications
- **Primary Target**: Modify `steps2` and `transitions2` data structures
- **Preserve Existing Logic**: Do not remove or break existing functionality in SFC2
- **Add Missing Paths**: Ensure all non-equivalent paths from the table above are covered

### 2. Implementation Guidelines
- **Data Structure Consistency**: Maintain the same format and structure as existing entries
- **Variable Naming**: Use consistent naming conventions with the existing codebase
- **Z3 Integration**: Properly implement Z3 conditions and data transformations as specified
- **Error Handling**: Consider edge cases and potential conflicts

### 3. Code Quality Standards
- **Python Best Practices**: Follow PEP 8 and Python coding standards
- **Clear Comments**: Add brief comments for complex logic or non-obvious additions
- **Maintainability**: Write code that integrates cleanly with the existing structure

## Expected Output Format

Please provide:

1. **Modified `steps2`**: The complete updated steps2 data structure
2. **Modified `transitions2`**: The complete updated transitions2 data structure
3. **Brief Explanation**: A concise explanation of key changes made (2-3 sentences)

### Example Output Format:
```python
# Modified steps2
steps2 = {
    # ... existing entries ...
    # New entries added for equivalence
}

# Modified transitions2
transitions2 = {
    # ... existing entries ...
    # New entries added for equivalence
}
```

**Key Changes Made**: [Brief explanation of the modifications and how they address the missing paths]

## Success Criteria
- All paths from the non-equivalent paths table are now executable in SFC2
- No existing functionality in SFC2 is broken or removed
- Code follows the established patterns and conventions
- Z3 conditions and transformations are correctly implemented

## Important Notes
- Focus on **functional equivalence** rather than identical implementation
- If there are conflicts between paths, prioritize maintaining existing SFC2 behavior
- Ensure all new transitions have proper conditions and data transformations
- Test your logic mentally to ensure the paths flow correctly

Please implement the necessary changes to achieve SFC equivalence.
